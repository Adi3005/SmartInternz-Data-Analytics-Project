The insurance dataset used in this project is a comprehensive collection of data that provides insights into various factors influencing insurance costs. 
The dataset includes information such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and medical charges. With over 1330 records, 
this dataset offers a diverse range of data for analysis and exploration. By leveraging this insurance dataset, valuable patterns, relationships, and trends 
can be uncovered to understand the drivers of insurance costs. The dataset allows examination of the impact of different variables, such as age, BMI, and smoking 
status, on medical charges. Furthermore, the inclusion of demographic information, such as sex and region, provides an opportunity to explore how insurance costs 
vary across different groups. The insurance dataset serves as a valuable resource for conducting statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization. 
It enables the extraction of insights into the factors that contribute to insurance costs, aiding in informed decisions related to healthcare management, cost 
optimization, and resource allocation. The dataset has been carefully curated and preprocessed to ensure its quality and reliability. Various analytical techniques 
and methodologies will be employed to extract meaningful insights and draw actionable conclusions from the data. This project aims to contribute to the existing 
knowledge in the field of insurance and healthcare analytics using this rich and extensive dataset.
